# Monocoque sample project

This project demonstrates a simple Gui application using the
Monocoque framework. The main features of Cocoon are the follwing:

 - output is a single statically linked executable that can be copied and run anywhere, even on Linux
 - all resources (images etc) are embedded inside the app
 - all dependencies come as source from [wrapdb](http://wrapdb.mesonbuild.com) automatically, no need to install dependencies on any platform

## Why is is called Monocoque?

A monocoque is a construct where a small outer shell contains the innards. As an example
the cockpit of a Formula one car is a monocoque.
